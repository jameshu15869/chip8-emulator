# CHIP-8 Emulator üïπÔ∏è

This project attempts to emulate a [CHIP-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) system using idiomatic C++. This project follows the specifications from [Cowgod](http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM). The graphics were created with [SDL 2](https://www.libsdl.org/). Tests were created with [GoogleTest](http://google.github.io/googletest/).
